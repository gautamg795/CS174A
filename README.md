### Assignment 1
###### CS174A - Spring '15 - Prof. Friedman
* * * 
#### Project Requirements (Implemented)
>1. Implement assignment cleanly/legibly with code comments and readme.
>2. Setup WebGL capable HTML canvas with size 960x540 with z-buffer enable and cleared to black background.
Implement necessary shaders without error.
>3. Display 8 cubes using perspective projection at (±10, ±10, ±10) from the origin in different colors.
Outline the edges in white. The 'c' character should cycle colors between the cubes. Cubes should display in square aspect ratio.
All 8 cubes should be visible from camera's initial position.
>4. Implement camera navigation with keyboard. Up/down arrow keys control position along y-axis, left/right arrow keys control heading.
'i', 'j', 'k', and 'm'control forward, left, right, and backward respectively, relative to the current heading.
Key presses move 1 degree or 0.25 units as appropriate. X-Z plane translation is relative to the current heading.
>5. 'n' and 'w' keys make the horizontal field of view narrower and wider respectively. The aspect ratio does not change.

#### Project Requirements (Not yet implemented)
>1. '+' toggles an orthographic projection of crosshairs centered on the scene.
